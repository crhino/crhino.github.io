Who am I? I am finding out the answer to that question every day, and
it always seems to be changing. I was born in Shaker Heights, Ohio and
lived there for the first 18 years of my life. I then went to Tufts
University, class of '14, having no idea what I wanted to do. Eventually 
I ended up falling in love with Computer Science as a sophomore, and I 
have continued down that road ever since.I currently work at Pivotal Labs
in San Francisco, on the open source Cloud Foundry project. My main interests 
are in Distributed Systems, Peer-to-Peer Networks, and Graph Theory.
